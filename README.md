In this assignment, we implemented the GrabCut algorithm to perform foreground segmentation on an input image.
We were then required to replace the background of the segmented object using Poisson blending, which is a powerful image editing technique that seamlessly blends the foreground object with a new background while preserving the object's texture and color.
